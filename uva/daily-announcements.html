## Exam 1 issues
- My grand solution to not count question 14 (the big-Theta question) was met with a lackluster reception
- So, taking into account the fact that you all disliked my solution...
- Question 14 has now been regraded
- The new average for the exam is 31.44/60 (65.5%) with a stdev of 8.6 (17.8%)
  - The curve will still be 15 *percentage* points
- The grading guidelines will be released later today, and the regrades open for "10" days
  - Until the Friday *after* spring break
  - So here 10 days == 19 days (see!  10 is a prime number!)
- If there are any other concerns with that question, please submit a regrade
  - Please be aware of the [frivolous regrade policy](frivolous-regrades.html) before you submit a regrade!

## Pop Quiz!

I have worked on [Lab 6](../../labs/lab06/index.html) (lists), and I think:

1. It's easy!
2. It's hard, but doable
3. It's insane!  Where do you get off assigning this much work?
4. I'm not talking to you.  Ever.  Again.
5. I wasnt' speaking to you since lab 2 anyway...

## Exam 1 issues
- Question 14 (the big-Theta proof) was graded incorrectly
  - This was my fault, as I didn't prep those grading it regrading how I went over it in class
- What will happen is that this question will not count at all toward the exam score
  - So the exam will be out of 42 points rather than 48 points
- All of your exams will be re-generated with the updated scoring, although the comments will remain
- This will take some time to do -- hopefully by Monday
- At that point, the grading guidelines will be released and regrades will open
  - The regrades will stay open until well after spring break
  - Please be aware of the [frivolous regrade policy](frivolous-regrades.html) before you submit a regrade!
- The curve will still be 15 *percentage* points

## Returning of lab grades
- We aim to have them returned one "week" later
  - Read: 10 days after the post-lab is due
- So lab 1 is to be returned today
- Grading guidelines are posted in the Collab wiki
- Once returned, you have one "week" (read: 10 days) to submit a regrade
- A regrade is ONLY if we screwed up the grading
  - It is NOT a chance for you to re-do the work
- We will be VERY strict about the 10 day regrade window!
- You can fill out a regrade via the [regrades course tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/regrades.php)

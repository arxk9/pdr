I didn't really run into any big issues besides just changing all the places I used the STL stack from "stack<int>"" to "MyStack." The only change I made to the List class was adding another method called removeAtTail so that I could easily pop from the end of my list. Each of the methods in MyStack were only a few lines since List was already pretty thoroughly implemented.

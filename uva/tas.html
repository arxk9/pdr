My name is Anna Cuddeback and I’m a second year from Medford, Massachusetts studying computer engineering and physics. Outside of TAing and classes, I do physics research, resident-advise a first year dorm, and an officer in Outdoors at UVa. I’m really into my chacos, and my diet primarily subsets of peanut butter Clif bars and Dunkin Donuts iced coffee. I am also emotionally attached to my Nalgene. If you’re not sure where I am, you can probably find me climbing at Slaughter or scooping up deals at the local Goodwill. Like Dwight Schrute, I always keep an extra set of Birkenstocks in the car for special occasions. <br clear="all"></p>

I’m a fourth year in the E-School studying Computer Science with an Engineering Business minor. I grew up in the town of Swanton, Vermont and studied abroad in Auckland, New Zealand for a semester my second year. My hobbies include being an Engineering Guide, hiking, climbing, and playing basically any sport I can get my hands on, though I particularly love basketball and throwing the football on the Hereford lawn. I’m also genuinely curious to know how many people actually read these bios, so if you see me at office hours (Mondays 8-10pm), tell me a fun fact about yourself and I’ll give you a special surprise! <br clear="all"></p>

I am Sam Spelsberg, third year in e-school CS, with a focus in Cyber Security. 2150 is one of my favorite classes in the CS major, and I believe that the concepts I learned in this class have been foundational to the rest of my computer science experience. I now strive to help other students learn, and get as much as possible from this course.<p>
I love traveling, and experiencing other cultures, and I hope to travel to each continent some day. I was born in Seattle and I will always love the west coast. Social Psychology is my favorite course I've taken outside of the engineering school, and I find the studies of human behavior, philosophy, ethics, and history fascinating.<p>
Hit me up if you ever have any questions about cyber security!
